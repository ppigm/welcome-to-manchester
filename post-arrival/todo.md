A general practitioner (GPs) is a local family doctor. General practitioners (GPs) treat all common (less serious) medical conditions and refer patients to hospitals and other medical services for urgent and specialist treatment.  
Make sure you register with an NHS GP within the first few weeks after your arrival in Manchester. You can choose to register with any local GP, or even at the health center attached to your university! There is no charge to register with a GP in England.
