# Essentials

You may want to bring a few **essentials** to Manchester, such as 

- [ ] Personal medication 
- [ ] Indonesian food or spices
- [ ] Socket adaptor
- [ ] Batik and formal wear for special occasions 
- [ ] Study tools 
- [ ] Mask

You may also bring money if you wish. However, **[do not](https://www.gov.uk/bringing-cash-into-uk)** bring more than Â£ 10,000 in cash. Bring a debit/credit card that can be used in the UK for your first weeks in Manchester as it takes weeks/months to open a UK bank account.
