# Tier 4 Visa Application    
UK Tier 4 Visa route for overseas students has been changed to the UK Student Visa route. This new UK Student Visa program is a simplified global visa system, which applies equally to all international students including EEA European Union nationals. 
You can apply for a student visa to study in the UK if you’re 16 or over and you:     

- have been offered a place on a course by a licensed student sponsor, You must have an unconditional offer of a place on a course with a licensed student sponsor.  
- To prove this, your education provider will send you a reference number (called a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)) once they’ve offered you a place on the course. You need a CAS before you can apply for your visa. 
- have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course - the amount will vary depending on your circumstances. If you’ve been in the UK with a valid visa for at least 12 months, you do not need to prove you have this money for your visa application. You’ll need to show you have enough money to support yourself - unless you’ve been in the UK with a valid visa for at least 12 months on the date of your application. How much money you need depends on where you will be studying. You’ll need either: £1,334 per month (for up to 9 months) for courses in London or £1,023 per month (for up to 9 months) for courses outside London. If you’re boarding at a residential independent school, you’ll need to pay boarding fees instead. The amount you need to pay will be on your CAS. London means the City of London and the 32 London boroughs. You’ll need to prove you have extra money for each family member you bring with you. You must have this money for at least 28 consecutive days. The end date of the 28-day period must be within 31 days of the date you apply for your visa. Example If you submit your application on 1 January 2021, you’d have to show that the funds were in your bank account for at least the 28-day period ending on 1 December. If you have a student loan or financial sponsorship, you’ll need to provide evidence of this from your loan or sponsorship company.
